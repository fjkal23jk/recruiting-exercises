My Approach: 
    In terms of the language of my choice, I decided to use Javascript, and that's the case becasue my main interest and goal are mostly toward Full Stack and Software Development. I have been programming Javascript for over a year and have taken both the front end and back end courses at my university. 

    In terms of the problem itself, I have written comments and description in details in [index.js] file.
    


Testing:
    I think I have covered all cases regarding to problem. The tool I use to write my unit-testing was Mocha.
    In order to run the test, you must have Mocha install in your local machine.
    Steps: 
        1. Navigate to [src] folder.
        2. Open Terminal
        3. run [npm install mocha] (if you haven't done so).
        4. run [npm run test]
